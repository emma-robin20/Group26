# Group26 Project
There are two main files in the folder:
model_app.R: This is used to run the interactive dashboard. A user can open the .Rproj to open the whole project and files or the model_app.R file and hit the "Run App" button in the upper right hand coner. 
sick_simualtion.R: This file contains a single function that is used to run the simulation. It takes in a variety of user inputs to get an output of a dataframe to be used for visualizations and analysis. 

The best way to open the files is by using opening the .Rproj file. This will open the relevant files and saved data. 
By opening the model_app.R file will have a "Run App" button in the upper right hand corner to run the dashboard. 

The dashboard has the following tabs:
Infection Network: this has a network visualization of a single run over time. 
Infection Timeline: Shows over time the infection spreading in graph visualizations. 
Monte Carlos: Setting for a single run and the monte carlos runs with graphs underneath showing the infection speading. 
Monte Carlos Daily Distribution: monte carlos analysis results.
